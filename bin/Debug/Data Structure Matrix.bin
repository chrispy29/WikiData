ArrayArrayLinearÒAn Array is a data structure that can hold multiple variables of the same data type. An array is declared by specifying the data type of the elements to be held within the array, with the size delcared as well.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-Linear¡A Binary Search Tree is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all keys in the respective node's left subtree.GraphGraphs
Non-Linear†A Graph is a data structure that contains a finite number of vertices and a finite set of edges connecting the vertices. There are undirected graphs, meaning you can go back and forth between vertices, and directed graphs, where you can only go in one direction.
Hash TableHash
Non-LinearæA hash table is a collection that stores key-value pairs. Lookups are optimized by computing the hash code of each key, stores it in a different bucket, then matches the hash code to the specified key when the values are accessed.HeapTree
Non-LinearÂA Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is essentially an almost complete tree which satisfies the heap property. It is one maximally efficient implementation of a priority queue.Linked ListListLinear–A linked list is a collection of elements whose order is not given by their physical place in the memory, but instead each element points to the next.ListListLinear±A list is a collection of objects that can be accessed by index, and have methods for sorting, searching and modifying the list. They can contain elements of the specified type.QueueAbstractLinear¼A queue is a collection that stores elements in a "first in first out" style. All elements are stored in the order they were added, and elements are removed from oldest first until newest.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-Linear›A Self-Balance Tree is a height-balanced binary search tree that automatically keeps height as small as possible when either insertion or deletion happens.SetAbstract
Non-Linear™A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and the elements are not in any particular order. It provides high-performance set operations.StackAbstractLinear¶A stack is a collection that works int the opposite way to a queue. The last element added to the stack is the first that will be removed from it, until reaching the oldest elements.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearrA two-dimension array can hold data in rows and columns, with the size of each declared when the array is created.
